## 🧠 Insights & Findings

### SQL Analysis Highlights <a href ="https://github.com/Zeraphael/Top-100-Hospitals-in-africa/blob/main/Top_100_Hospitals_In_Africa_Analysis---SQL.sql"> SQL files</a>
- **ICU Capacity**: Top hospitals have ICU beds exceeding 100+, but many lack proportional staffing.
- **Ambulance Gaps**: Several hospitals operate without ambulance services, especially in rural regions.
- **Doctor-to-Patient Ratio**: Some hospitals serve over 1,000 patients per doctor monthly.
- **Staffing Disparities**: Northern and Western regions show lower specialist and nurse counts.
- **Ownership Impact**: Public hospitals tend to have higher patient loads but lower budgets.
- **Infrastructure Age**: Many hospitals were built before 2000, with limited modernization.
- **Bed Utilization**: Some hospitals report over 90% bed usage, indicating high demand and possible overcrowding.

### PivotTable Dashboards

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Expand Ambulance Coverage**: Prioritize emergency transport in underserved regions.
- **Increase Specialist Staffing**: Target hiring in regions with low specialist-to-patient ratios.
- **Modernize Infrastructure**: Invest in upgrading hospitals built before 2000.
- **Balance Patient Load**: Redistribute patients or resources to reduce strain on public hospitals.
- **Improve Equipment Access**: Ensure MRI and X-ray machines are available in all major hospitals.
- **Boost Accreditation Efforts**: Support hospitals in achieving accreditation to improve care standards.
